# pdf-split-linux

This uses PDFTK in burst mode to split a large pdf into individual pages. 

- Place "pdf-splitz.sh" on the desktop or whereever. 
- Create a folder "working" on the desktop, and place the "pdfsplit.sh" into that.
- You can now ./pdf-splits.sh from the desktop. 
- The script will split the named file in the script, and delete (rm) the 2 config 
files that it also creates.
